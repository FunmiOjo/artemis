      "description_original": "Justin Jackson is no stranger to this show. Technically this is only his second appearance (check out his first time on TGM), but there are hours of recorded conversations floating around my hard drive. I always enjoy talking to Justin. Despite how much we have in common, he always helps me see things from a fresh and different angle. And his episode was no exception.\u00a0 Every time we talk, it's like catching up with an old friend. And even though we only just met in person for the first time at MicroConf in Las Vegas, he is indeed someone I would consider an old friend. Justin's career has spanned the gamut of the product, start up and SaaS worlds. He's an author, podcaster, educator and most recently a SaaS founder. There's no bonus episode this week because I decided to release the entire conversation. At just over 120 minutes, it's a long one, but worth listening to. Our conversation ranged from parenting, to business building, to the things that hold us back as entrepreneurs, to why every entrepreneur should have a therapist, and literally everything you could imagine in-between. These are my favorite kinds of episodes, because there's so much to glean from a guy like Justin about life in general. I hope you love it as much as I do.

But he's also expanding into done-for-you podcasting.\u00a0In fact, I had a bit of a mini freakout when he first announced the new service, because it was so close to Podcast Royale (which hadn't been launched yet). We talked about that and what to do when your idea is very similar to something that already exists.",
