He seems happy and content with his work and is able to change it up when he needs/wants to.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Basically the opposite of everything I did when I was a full-time freelancer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In all seriousness, though, Paul and I talk on a fairly regular basis and it&rsquo;s great when we&rsquo;re able to record a conversation like this&mdash;about meaning, happiness, what we like, what we don&rsquo;t, what we wish were different.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is my favorite kind of TGM episode.</p>\n<p>And Paul is a great, no-nonsense guy to learn from.

      "description": "<p>How do you interview someone you&rsquo;ve known your whole life?</p>\n<p>Nate is a Grammy-nominated musician, whom I met when I was 12. We started one band together when we were teens and then later in my mid-20s I joined his current band as the drummer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After one album and a couple years of touring I ended up leaving the band, but Nate has stuck with and continues to put out music that just gets better and better.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Besides being one of my best friends, Nate&rsquo;s story is a perfect example of sticking with a dream even when it practically kills you. Lots of ups and downs both financial and personal, but he&rsquo;s stuck with it and I admire him for that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never had someone on the show that I had this much history with and had known for so long, so, honestly, I wasn&rsquo;t sure how it was going to go.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But I&rsquo;m glad we did it because it turned out great. Despite all my curmudgeonly attempts to <em>not</em> be inspirational, this one definitely veers into that territory. He may not admit it, but I think Nate is an optimist, and like he says, you really can do whatever it is you want to do with your live&mdash;if you&rsquo;re willing to put in the required effort and stick with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Check out the full episode desciption and show notes at http://avclark.com/57</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
